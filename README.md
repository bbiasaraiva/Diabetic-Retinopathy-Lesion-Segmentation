# Diabetic-Retinopathy-Lesion-Segmentation

**Project developed under the scope of Artificial Intelligence Fundamentals course, 2024/2025.
**

## Overview

This project focuses on segmenting lesions in retinal images caused by diabetic retinopathy, a common diabetes complication.  The goal is to identify and classify affected regions using [ALGORITHM USED!!!]

## Dataset

-  The dataset should be placed in the same directory as the .ipynb file.
<!-- -  Example structure:
  [NO FIM METER A ESTRUTURA DA PASTA E COMO Ã‰ USADO NO]

## Usage

Ensure dependencies are installed (list key libraries like TensorFlow/PyTorch, OpenCV, PIL, etc.):

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Open and run the Jupyter Notebook (*.ipynb).

## Key Features
Briefly mention methods used (e.g., U-Net, preprocessing steps, evaluation metrics like Dice score).

## Results
(Optional) Add sample images/predictions or metrics (accuracy, IoU). -->
